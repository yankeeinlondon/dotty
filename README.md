# Dotty

> A **flake** for booting [**NixOS**]() into I3wm, Sway, or Hyprland 

## Usage

To get started:

```sh
# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yankeeinlondon/dotty 
# move into the repo
cd dotty
# view CLI options:
just
```

> Note: you'll need the `just` _runner_ installed; if you don't have it you can load it into a shell with `nix-shell -p just`. If you do end up using this as your bootloader then **just** will always be an available option.
